## Funky Website

I always wanted to make a funky website. You can view it [here](www.artaseyedian.com).

## Features

- **Dynamic HDR Environments**: Utilize high dynamic range imaging to create realistic lighting and reflections.
- **Interactive GUI**: Control various aspects of the website in real-time with an intuitive graphical user interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Lazy Loading**: Non-essential scripts are loaded lazily to improve the initial load time.

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): For rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): As the build tool for fast development and production builds.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): To serve the website and handle backend logic.
- [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui): For the interactive GUI elements.
